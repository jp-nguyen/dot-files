# dot-files

Here are my dot files for whichever UNIX system I ever move to (or whenever I
need to switch laptops). There are two dot files:
- bash\_profile: for my bash environment
- vimrc: for my VIM environment

I don't have much experience in configuring my environment yet, but as I get
more experience and learn more overall, these files should be more customized.
