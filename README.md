# dot-files

Here are my dot files for whichever UNIX system I ever move to (or whenever I
need to switch laptops). There are two dot files:
- bash\_profile: for my bash environment
- vimrc: for my VIM environment

I don't have much experience in configuring my environment yet, but as I get
more experience and learn more overall, these files should be more customized.

## Motivations for bash\_profile

I was aiming to make Terminal similar to my Linux terminal back at my old 
internship, so I first updated the colors of ls. Defaulting to a black
background, I noticed that colored text looked better to me in bold, so
all instances of colored text on black were bold. This carried over when I
customized my PS1 variable.
